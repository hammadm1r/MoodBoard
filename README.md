Installation

    Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

Set up XAMPP with MySQL and PHP:

    Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP.
    Import the provided MySQL database schema (moodboard.sql) into your MySQL database.

Update the database credentials in the PHP files (e.g., config.php):

    define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
    define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
    define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
    define('DB_DATABASE', 'moodboard');
    

    Open the project in your browser (http://localhost/moodboard).

Usage

    Register an account with a username, email, and password.
    Once logged in, input your mood (e.g., happy, sad, motivated).
    The application will send a request to an external AI to generate a mood-based quote.
    You can save the quote to your favorite list for later use.
